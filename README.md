## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on e-commerce product reviews to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. It helps businesses understand customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

## Features
- Sentiment classification of product reviews
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Visualization of sentiment distribution
- Easy-to-use interface for analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup
